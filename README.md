# Pizza Bar

You have been contracted by an up and coming artisanal pizza restaurant to build them an API that can:

  - Create new pizzas
  - Return a list of pizzas
  - Return a single pizza

They have been kind enough to write some tests to check that your work satisfies their needs.


### Getting started:

#### - If have ruby installed on your computer and want to run the tests locally
```
bin/setup
```

Run the tests
```
bin/test
```

#### - If you want to run the tests via docker
```
docker-compose build
```

Run the tests
```
docker-compose run pizza bundle exec rspec
```

### Task
1. Write code that makes the test pass
2. Run the tests again
3. Write more code to make the next test pass
4. Repeat until all the tests pass

Good luck ðŸ˜€
